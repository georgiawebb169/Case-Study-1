# Case-Study-1
Danny Ma has created a collection of [SQL challenges](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) designed to enhance your problem-solving abilities in SQL. This repository contains my personal solutions to those tasksâ€”keep in mind, there are often several valid approaches to each problem.

For Case Study 1, I used Snowflake to load the data, as part of getting more comfortable with that environment. Some of my queries may not be compatible with other SQL platforms due to variations in function names and feature support.
